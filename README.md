# üéì Ippon Australia Tech Workshop Collection

## What is this?
Micro-workshops to further your understanding of real world software development workflows.

## Why?
As a student I had an understanding of programming concepts, discrete math, algorithms, big-O and all that other Jazz. Howerver, there was a lack of more real world concepts especially relating to high level design, integration, testing and how all these amazing pieces of software are stitched together to really create something valuable.

## Structure
Each workshop will follow a similar structure including an introduction, steps through to complete the workshop, challenge and final solution/hints. It will be difficult and not all information will be given to you so some of this you need to figure out on your own! Some solutions and hints will be given as extras/solutions as below:

Send a new POST request using `curl` to test your login API and make sure it responds with the correct format.
